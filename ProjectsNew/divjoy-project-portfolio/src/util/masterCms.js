    subtitle: "I am a junior full stack developer. I enjoy building projects with JavaScript, React, Python and accompanying libraries and frameworks. The bulk of my work includes sourcing data either via webscraping techniques or authenticating access to an API. Then annalyzing or applying algorithms to the data to discover new insights. As well as building a front end client to interact with that data or make it accessible to the general end user. I enjoy using a large set of tools and technologies including Wordpress, Shopify, and Salesforce as other backend solutions. But for the most part I like to build websites and apps that are data driven and data centric. You will usually find me tinkering with data using Python or JavaScript and then building some front end in React to access that data and make it usable in a new way. And I also love integrations typically through RESTful APIs.",

        answer:
          "Some college but I am mostly self taught. From a lot of different sources actually. Most memorably, I started off with Treehouse.com. That's where I learned introductory HTML and CSS. From there another more memorable platform by far is FreeCodeCamp.com. That's a resource I still use today. Then honestly, YouTube was always another huge source of truth for me with programming and then I occassionally purchase a Udemy course here and there. There are a lot more resources I use to learn to code as well but these are the main ones.",

        question: "What do you like most about programming?",
        answer:
          "To be honest, just about everything. I like learning so this was a great fit. Not only that but for whatever reason I have just always had an affinity for computers. At this point in my development journey though I just love coming up with an idea or a solution to a problem and being able to go out there and build it.",

        question: "What is one of your greatest ambitions?",
        answer:
          "You know probably just to be a good dad. I don't think it was something I ever thought about too much growing up but after having my son one of my greatest ambitions is just to be a good parent, to support my family, and give my family the quality of life they deserve. I believe I found a way to do that through programming and so as a result another one of my greatest ambitions would be to become a software engineer or technical architect.",

        question: "One cool thing to note about this portfolio.",
        answer:
          "One of my favorite things about this portfolio project is that it is heavily API driven, and the rest of the native data is abstracted to a central location that is easy to manage as well as capable of being replaced with a substitue data/content source. From the Wordpress posts, the Github repos, and the rest of the content, all driven by API. The components are all also heavily reusable passing props down all the way from the highest levels.",
